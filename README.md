Autoexec.cfg creator
==============



Getting Started
--------------

After downloading your newly aquired autoexec file, you will want to place this in `...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`


Why?
--------------
Because why not. Autoexecs are largely handwritten, this just addresses the menace of having to manually write your own autoexec.


How?
--------------
Primarly created using JavaScript, html5, some php.
