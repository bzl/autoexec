Autoexec.cfg creator
==============



Getting Started
--------------

After downloading your newly acquired autoexec file, you will want to place this in `...\Steam\steamapps\common\Counter-Strike Global Offensive\csgo\cfg`


Why?
--------------
Because why not. Autoexecs are largely handwritten, this just addresses the menace of having to manually write your own autoexec.


How?
--------------
Primarily created using jQuery, html5, php. Sorry for using PHP. I used jQuery because you can never get enough jQuery. Never.
